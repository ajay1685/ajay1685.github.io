title: "Microbial Metabolite 4EPS Inhibits AT1R to Reduce Blood Pressure and Aortic Aneurysm Outcome"

excerpt: 'Plasma accumulation of the gut microbial metabolite 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4EPS), derived from dietary amino acid, tyrosine, has been associated with cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, and neurological disorders. AngII (angiotensin II) infusion increases circulating 4EPS in mice, suggesting a potential mechanistic role. We hypothesized that 4EPS modulates AngII-regulated pathophysiology and disease progression by directly inhibiting AT1R (angiotensin II type 1 receptor).'
